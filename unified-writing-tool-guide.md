# **Unified Writing Rules and Style Guide**

Follow these rules to adapt our human writing style to create well-written content that goes undetected as ai content when using tools like GPTzero.

## **1\. Core Philosophy**

* Write like you are explaining something to a friend over coffee.

* Natural, direct, steady tone: “Here is what actually works when you rent a car in a busy city” or “Here is what most people get wrong when choosing a neighborhood.”

* Avoid corporate or polished energy.

* Always aim to help someone who is searching for the primary keyword.

* Give useful, real information that solves their problem.

## **2\. Tone and Voice**

### **This style is:**

* Conversational with authority

* Direct and actionable

* Personal without being cheesy or cringy

* Practical and grounded

* Honest about what works or fails

* Open about bias when relevant

**Example:**  
 “This shortcut sounds obvious, but most people skip it, and that is the part that usually creates the problem.”

### **This style is not:**

* Corporate

* Scripted

* Fluffy

* Academic

* Full of buzzwords

**Example of what to avoid:**  
 “Our comprehensive suite of optimized solutions ensures…”  
 This is banned tone.

## **3\. Writing Mechanics**

### **Sentence Structure:**

* Write at a fifth grade reading level.

* One idea per sentence.

* Use contractions.

* No back to back identical sentence structures.

* Natural flow, not perfect.

* Use active voice.  
* You can use variations of keywords to make the content flow better and have proper grammar. For example, if a keyword you want to include is “Vancouver limo service”, don’t use “How much does Vancouver Limo Service cost?”. That is weird grammar and feels forced. Instead use, “How much do Vancouver limo services cost?”or “How much do limo services in Vancouver cost”. Both of those acceptable keyword variations can count toward keyword density.

**Example:**  
 Correct: “You get a smoother ride when the tires are warmed up in cold weather.”  
 Incorrect: “The vehicle’s performance can be optimized when factoring in environmental temperature variables.”

### **Paragraph Structure:**

* Short paragraphs are allowed. Vary paragraph lengths so it’s not always predictable.  
* One point per paragraph.

* Use white space for readability.

### **Punctuation:**

* Replace em dashes with commas or colons.

* Example fix:  
   Bad: “The car is powerful all around: the kind you take on a trip for the weekend, the kind you remember.”  
   Good: “The car is powerful all around, the kind you take on a trip for the weekend, the kind you remember.”

* Never add a space at the start of a new line.

* Never use divider lines.

## **4\. Forbidden Words and Phrases**

Do not use any of these:

embark, look no further, navigating, picture this, top notch, unleash, unlock, unveil, we have got you covered, transition, crucial, delve, daunting, deep dive, realm, ensure, in conclusion, in summary, optimal, assessing, firstly, strive, furthermore, moreover, comprehensive, we know, we understand, testament, captivating, eager, refreshing, edge of my seat, breath of fresh air, to consider, it is important to consider, there are a few considerations, it is essential to, vital, it is important to note, it should be noted, to sum up, secondly, lastly, in terms of, with regard to, it is worth mentioning, it is interesting to note, significantly, notably, essentially, as such, therefore, thus, interestingly, in essence, noteworthy, bear in mind, it is crucial to note, one might argue, it is widely acknowledged, predominantly, from this perspective, in this context, this demonstrates, arguably, it is common knowledge, undoubtedly, this raises the question, in a nutshell, unveiled, honestly, folks, fuss, bustle

**Example of a banned sentence:**  
 “Picture this, you are cruising along the coastline.”  
 Never use this pattern.

## **5\. Forbidden Writing Patterns**

Never use:

* “Whether you are… or…”  
   Example banned:  
   “Whether you are landing at the airport or heading out for a ski trip…”

* “From… to…”  
   Example banned:  
   “From high ceilings to wood floors…”

* “…meets…”  
   Example banned:  
   “Timeless design meets modern style.”

These are high risk AI detection patterns.

## **6\. SEO Requirements**

* Primary keyword density: one to one point five percent.

* Only place the keyword where it sounds natural.

* Include natural variations in H2 and H3 headings.

* Title: fifty to sixty characters.

* Meta description: maximum one hundred forty characters.

* Include internal links with properly chosen anchor text.

* External links must be helpful, non competing, and credible.

* Never show a visible URL in the article. URL’s are to be hyperlinked to anchor keywords.

* Always hyperlink the URL to anchor text. Anchor keywords are strategic SEO keywords. For example, don’t use “Check out Whistler tourism at https://[whistlertourism.ca](http://whistlertourism.ca) for information on the best activities to do in Whistler this winter”, instead hyperlink the word “Whistler tourism” and the st

* Use Canadian English if writing for Canadian topics.

**Example of correct linking instruction for the outline:**  
 Internal link one:

* Anchor keyword: “luxury car rentals in Vancouver”

* URL: [https://example.com (this would be anchored to the keyword, not displayed as is).](https://example.com)

## **7\. Content Requirements**

* Write from the company’s point of view, not a single employee.

* Include opinions.

* Include one short, natural personal anecdote if it fits.  
   Example:  
   “Last month someone asked if a performance SUV could handle a winter highway run. I told them what most people forget: tires matter more than horsepower in the cold.”

* All facts must be real and verifiable, except for one personal story.

* Only client or personal stories can be made up.

* Include neighbourhood or area context when relevant.  
   Example:  
   “Most visitors stay around the waterfront since it gives you quick access to shopping and restaurants.”  
* Do not include information you’re unsure about. Example, don’t say the minimum age requirement for rentals unless you’re certain the age, don’t say the price of certain things without confirmation.  
* Don’t mention the actual company address. You have it for location context only.  
* DO NOT include a footer   
  

## **8\. Research Requirements**

* Check Reddit, TikTok, and forums for real user questions.

* Look at top ranking articles and find gaps.

* Verify local details through city websites or official sources. Try to use unique content so similar topic articles don’t use the same external links, if possible.

* Do not copy competitor content.

**Example:**  
 If writing about safety in a neighborhood, you might pull real insights from a discussion thread of locals talking about lighting, parking, or noise levels.

## **9\. Headings and Structure**

* Use H2 and H3 only.

* Make headings descriptive and helpful.

* Include natural keyword variations when possible.

**General article flow:**

* Direct hook  
   Example: “Most people pick a rental based on looks, then get frustrated when the drive feels rough.”

* Context

* Main content sections

* Examples or scenarios

* Practical takeaways

* Seven to ten FAQ questions

## **10\. FAQ Requirements**

* Minimum seven to ten FAQs.

* Bold the question.

* No Q or A labels. No “Question” and “Answer Labels”

* Questions should be what real people search. They should be SEO focused. Example: Don’t say “How much does it cost” because no one searches that on Google. Instead say “How much do limo services cost in Vancouver”.

* Answers should be simple and conversational while also being SEO focused. Example, don’t say “it costs around $200/hour”. Instead say “Limo services in Vancouver start at around $200 per hour”.

## **11\. Internal and External Linking Rules**

### **Internal Links:**

* Only use strategic SEO anchor text.

* Example anchor text: “best luxury SUVs” or “exotic cars for rent in Vancouver.”

* Do not use “click here” or generic wording.

* Add each link in the outline like this:

  * Anchor keyword: \[your keyword\]

  * URL: \[your link\]

### **External Links:**

* Use verified, helpful sources.

* Examples:  
   • Government transportation websites  
   • Official tourism sites  
   • Manufacturer specs pages
